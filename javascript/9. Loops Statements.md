# Loops Statements

## [Why are loops useful?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code#why_are_loops_useful)

## Looping through a collection

Most of the time when you use a loop, you will have a collection of items and want to do something with every item.

One type of collection is the Array, which we met in the Arrays chapter of this course. But there are other collections in JavaScript as well, including Set and Map.

### The for...of loop

The basic tool for looping through a collection is the `for...of` loop:

```js
const cats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

for (const cat of cats) {
  console.log(cat);
}
```

In this example, `for (const cat of cats)` says:

1. Given the collection cats, get the first item in the collection.
2. Assign it to the variable cat and then run the code between the curly brackets {}.
3. Get the next item, and repeat (2) until you've reached the end of the collection.

### map() and filter()

JavaScript also has more specialized loops for collections, and we'll mention two of them here.

You can use map() to do something to each item in a collection and create a new collection containing the changed items:

```js
function toUpper(string) {
  return string.toUpperCase();
}

const cats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

const upperCats = cats.map(toUpper);

console.log(upperCats);
// [ "LEOPARD", "SERVAL", "JAGUAR", "TIGER", "CARACAL", "LION" ]
```

Here we pass a function into cats.map(), and map() calls the function once for each item in the array, passing in the item. It then adds the return value from each function call to a new array, and finally returns the new array.

You can use filter() to test each item in a collection, and create a new collection containing only items that match:

```js
function lCat(cat) {
  return cat.startsWith("L");
}

const cats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

const filtered = cats.filter(lCat);

console.log(filtered);
// [ "Leopard", "Lion" ]
```

This looks a lot like map(), except the function we pass in returns a boolean: if it returns true, then the item is included in the new array. Our function tests that the item starts with the letter "L", so the result is an array containing only cats whose names start with "L":

Note that map() and filter() are both often used with function expressions, which we will learn about in the Functions module. Using function expressions we could rewrite the example above to be much more compact:

```js
const cats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

const filtered = cats.filter((cat) => cat.startsWith("L"));
console.log(filtered);
// [ "Leopard", "Lion" ]
```

## The standard for loop

In case of you have a code you want to run for N of times you can use the `for` loops.

```js
for (initializer; condition; final-expression) {
  // code to run
}
```

Here we have:

1. The keyword `for`, followed by some parentheses.
2. Inside the parentheses we have three items, separated by semicolons:
   1. An **initializer** — this is usually a variable set to a number, which is incremented to count the number of times the loop has run. It is also sometimes referred to as a counter variable.
   2. A **condition** — this defines when the loop should stop looping. This is generally an expression featuring a comparison operator, a test to see if the exit condition has been met.
   3. A **final-expression** — this is always evaluated (or run) each time the loop has gone through a full iteration. It usually serves to increment (or in some cases decrement) the counter variable, to bring it closer to the point where the condition is no longer true.
3. Some curly braces that contain a block of code — this code will be run each time the loop iterates.

### Calculating squares

Let's look at a real example so we can visualize what these do more clearly.

```js
const results = document.querySelector("#results");

function calculate() {
  for (let i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    const newResult = `${i} x ${i} = ${i * i}`;
    results.textContent += `${newResult}\n`;
  }
  results.textContent += "\nFinished!";
}

const calculateBtn = document.querySelector("#calculate");
const clearBtn = document.querySelector("#clear");

calculateBtn.addEventListener("click", calculate);
clearBtn.addEventListener("click", () => (results.textContent = ""));
```

This code calculates squares for the numbers from 1 to 9, and writes out the result. The core of the code is the `for` loop that performs the calculation.

Let's break down the `for (let i = 1; i < 10; i++)` line into its three pieces:

1. `let i = 1`: the counter variable, `i`, starts at `1`. Note that we have to use `let` for the counter, because we're reassigning it each time we go round the loop.
2. `i < 10`: keep going round the loop for as long as `i` is smaller than `10`.
3. `i++`: add one to `i` each time round the loop.

Inside the loop, we calculate the square of the current value of `i`, that is: `i * i`. We create a string expressing the calculation we made and the result, and add this string to the output text. We also add `\n`, so the next string we add will begin on a new line. So:

1. During the first run, `i = 1`, so we will add `1 x 1 = 1`.
2. During the second run, `i = 2`, so we will add `2 x 2 = 4`.
3. And so on…
4. When `i` becomes equal to `10` we will stop running the loop and move straight to the next bit of code below the loop, printing out the `Finished!` message on a new line.

### Looping through collections with a for loop

You can use a for loop to iterate through a collection, instead of a for...of loop.

Let's look again at our for...of example above:

```js
const cats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

for (const cat of cats) {
  console.log(cat);
}
```

We could rewrite that code like this:

```js
const cats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

for (let i = 0; i < cats.length; i++) {
  console.log(cats[i]);
}
```

In this loop we're starting `i` at `0`, and stopping when `i` reaches the length of the array. Then inside the loop, we're using `i` to access each item in the array in turn.

[Sometimes you still need to use a `for` loop to iterate through an array.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code#looping_through_collections_with_a_for_loop)

## Exiting loops with break

If you want to exit a loop before all the iterations have been completed, you can use the `break` statement. We already met this in the previous article when we looked at `switch` statements.

It's the same with loops — a `break` statement will immediately exit the loop and make the browser move on to any code that follows it.

Say we wanted to search through an array of contacts and telephone numbers and return just the number we wanted to find?

```html
<label for="search">Search by contact name: </label>
<input id="search" type="text" />
<button>Search</button>

<p></p>
```

```js
const contacts = [
  "Chris:2232322",
  "Sarah:3453456",
  "Bill:7654322",
  "Mary:9998769",
  "Dianne:9384975",
];
const para = document.querySelector("p");
const input = document.querySelector("input");
const btn = document.querySelector("button");

btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const searchName = input.value.toLowerCase();
  input.value = "";
  input.focus();
  para.textContent = "";
  for (const contact of contacts) {
    const splitContact = contact.split(":");
    if (splitContact[0].toLowerCase() === searchName) {
      para.textContent = `${splitContact[0]}'s number is ${splitContact[1]}.`;
      break;
    }
  }
  if (para.textContent === "") {
    para.textContent = "Contact not found.";
  }
});
```

## Skipping iterations with continue

The `continue` statement works similarly to `break`, but instead of breaking out of the loop entirely, it skips to the next iteration of the loop. 

Let's look at another example that takes a number as an input, and returns only the numbers that are squares of integers (whole numbers).

```html
<label for="number">Enter number: </label>
<input id="number" type="number" />
<button>Generate integer squares</button>

<p>Output:</p>
```

```js
const para = document.querySelector("p");
const input = document.querySelector("input");
const btn = document.querySelector("button");

btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  para.textContent = "Output: ";
  const num = input.value;
  input.value = "";
  input.focus();
  for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    // find the square root of each number
    let sqRoot = Math.sqrt(i);

    // check whether the square root is an integer by testing whether it is the same as itself when it has been rounded down to the nearest integer
    if (Math.floor(sqRoot) !== sqRoot) {
        // If the square root and the rounded down square root do not equal one another (!==), it means that the square root is not an integer, so we are not interested in it. 
      continue;
    }
    para.textContent += `${i} `;
  }
});
```
