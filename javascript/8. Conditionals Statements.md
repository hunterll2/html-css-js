# Conditionals Statements

## if...else statements
Let's look at by far the most common type of conditional statement you'll use in JavaScript — the humble if...else statement.

### Syntax
```js
if (condition) {
  /* code to run if condition is true */
} else {
  /* run some other code instead */
}
```

This code is pretty human-readable — it is saying "if the condition returns true, run code A, else run code B"

You should note that you don't have to include the else and the second curly brace block — the following is also perfectly legal code:

```js
if (condition) {
  /* code to run if condition is true */
}

/* run some other code */
```

As a final point you may sometimes see if...else statements written without the curly braces:

```js
if (condition) /* code to run if condition is true */
else /* run some other code instead */
```

### else if

The last example provided us with two choices, or outcomes — but what if we want more than two? There is a way to chain on extra choices/outcomes to your if...else — using else if — check out the following more involved example, which could be part of a simple weather forecast application:

```html
<label for="weather">Select the weather type today: </label>
<select id="weather">
  <option value="">--Make a choice--</option>
  <option value="sunny">Sunny</option>
  <option value="rainy">Rainy</option>
  <option value="snowing">Snowing</option>
  <option value="overcast">Overcast</option>
</select>

<p></p>
```

```js
const select = document.querySelector("select");
const para = document.querySelector("p");

select.addEventListener("change", setWeather);

function setWeather() {
  const choice = select.value;

  if (choice === "sunny") {
    para.textContent =
      "It is nice and sunny outside today. Wear shorts! Go to the beach, or the park, and get an ice cream.";
  } else if (choice === "rainy") {
    para.textContent =
      "Rain is falling outside; take a rain coat and an umbrella, and don't stay out for too long.";
  } else if (choice === "snowing") {
    para.textContent =
      "The snow is coming down — it is freezing! Best to stay in with a cup of hot chocolate, or go build a snowman.";
  } else if (choice === "overcast") {
    para.textContent =
      "It isn't raining, but the sky is grey and gloomy; it could turn any minute, so take a rain coat just in case.";
  } else {
    para.textContent = "";
  }
}
```

### Nesting if...else

It is perfectly OK to put one if...else statement inside another one — to nest them. For example, we could update our weather forecast application to show a further set of choices depending on what the temperature is:

```js
if (choice === "sunny") {
  if (temperature < 86) {
    para.textContent = `It is ${temperature} degrees outside — nice and sunny. Let's go out to the beach, or the park, and get an ice cream.`;
  } else if (temperature >= 86) {
    para.textContent = `It is ${temperature} degrees outside — REALLY HOT! If you want to go outside, make sure to put some sunscreen on.`;
  }
}
```

Even though the code all works together, each if...else statement works completely independently of the other one.

## A note on comparison operators

Comparison operators are used to test the conditions inside our conditional statements.

* `===` and `!==` — test if one value is identical to, or not identical to, another.
* `<` and `>` — test if one value is less than or greater than another.
* `<=` and `>=` — test if one value is less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to, another.

We wanted to make a special mention of testing boolean (`true`/`false`) values, and a common pattern you'll come across again and again. Any value that is not `false`, `undefined`, `null`, `0`, `NaN`, or an empty string (`''`) actually returns `true` when tested as a conditional statement, therefore you can use a variable name on its own to test whether it is `true`, or even that it exists (that is, it is not undefined.) So for example:

```js
let cheese = "Cheddar";

if (cheese) {
  console.log("Yay! Cheese available for making cheese on toast.");
} else {
  console.log("No cheese on toast for you today.");
}
```

## Logical operators: AND, OR and NOT

If you want to test multiple conditions without writing nested `if...else` statements, *logical operators* can help you. When used in *conditions*, the first two do the following:

* `&&` — AND; allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that all of them have to individually evaluate to `true` for the whole expression to return `true`.
* `||` — OR; allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that one or more of them have to individually evaluate to `true` for the whole expression to return `true`.

To give you an `AND` example, the previous example snippet can be rewritten to this:

```js
if (choice === "sunny" && temperature < 86) {
  para.textContent = `It is ${temperature} degrees outside — nice and sunny. Let's go out to the beach, or the park, and get an ice cream.`;
} else if (choice === "sunny" && temperature >= 86) {
  para.textContent = `It is ${temperature} degrees outside — REALLY HOT! If you want to go outside, make sure to put some sunscreen on.`;
}
```

Let's look at a quick `OR` example:

```js
if (iceCreamVanOutside || houseStatus === "on fire") {
  console.log("You should leave the house quickly.");
} else {
  console.log("Probably should just stay in then.");
}
```

The last type of logical operator, NOT, expressed by the `!` operator, can be used to negate an expression. Let's combine it with OR in the above example:

```js
if (!(iceCreamVanOutside || houseStatus === "on fire")) {
  console.log("Probably should just stay in then.");
} else {
  console.log("You should leave the house quickly.");
}
```

In this snippet, if the OR statement returns true, the NOT operator will negate it so that the overall expression returns false.

You can combine as many logical statements together as you want, in whatever structure. The following example executes the code inside only if both OR statements return true, meaning that the overall AND statement will return true:

```js
if ((x === 5 || y > 3 || z <= 10) && (loggedIn || userName === "Steve")) {
  // run the code
}
```

## Switch Statements

`if...else` statements do the job of enabling conditional code well, but they are not without their downsides. They are mainly good for cases where you've got a couple of choices, and each one requires a reasonable amount of code to be run, and/or the conditions are complex (for example, multiple logical operators). For cases where you just want to set a variable to a certain choice of value or print out a particular statement depending on a condition, the syntax can be a bit cumbersome, especially if you've got a large number of choices.

In such a case, `switch statements` are your friend — they take a single expression/value as an input, and then look through several choices until they find one that matches that value, executing the corresponding code that goes along with it. Here's some more pseudocode, to give you an idea:

```
switch (expression) {
  case choice1:
    // run this code
    break;
  case choice2:
    // run this code instead
    break;
  // include as many cases as you like
  default:
    // actually, just run this code
    break;
}
```

### A `switch` example

Let's have a look at a real example — we'll rewrite our weather forecast application to use a switch statement instead:

```html
<label for="weather">Select the weather type today: </label>
<select id="weather">
  <option value="">--Make a choice--</option>
  <option value="sunny">Sunny</option>
  <option value="rainy">Rainy</option>
  <option value="snowing">Snowing</option>
  <option value="overcast">Overcast</option>
</select>

<p></p>
```

```js
const select = document.querySelector("select");
const para = document.querySelector("p");

select.addEventListener("change", setWeather);

function setWeather() {
  const choice = select.value;

  switch (choice) {
    case "sunny":
      para.textContent =
        "It is nice and sunny outside today. Wear shorts! Go to the beach, or the park, and get an ice cream.";
      break;
    case "rainy":
      para.textContent =
        "Rain is falling outside; take a rain coat and an umbrella, and don't stay out for too long.";
      break;
    case "snowing":
      para.textContent =
        "The snow is coming down — it is freezing! Best to stay in with a cup of hot chocolate, or go build a snowman.";
      break;
    case "overcast":
      para.textContent =
        "It isn't raining, but the sky is grey and gloomy; it could turn any minute, so take a rain coat just in case.";
      break;
    default:
      para.textContent = "";
  }
}
```

### `switch` statement Fall-Through

```js
const Animal = "Giraffe";
switch (Animal) {
  case "Cow":
  case "Giraffe":
  case "Dog":
  case "Pig":
    console.log("This animal is not extinct.");
    break;
  case "Dinosaur":
  default:
    console.log("This animal is extinct.");
}
```

```js
const foo = 1;
let output = "Output: ";
switch (foo) {
  case 0:
    output += "So ";
  case 1:
    output += "What ";
    output += "Is ";
  case 2:
    output += "Your ";
  case 3:
    output += "Name";
  case 4:
    output += "?";
    console.log(output);
    break;
  case 5:
    output += "!";
    console.log(output);
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Please pick a number from 0 to 5!");
}
```

## Ternary operator

There is one final bit of syntax we want to introduce you to before we get you to play with some examples. The ternary or conditional operator is a small bit of syntax that tests a condition and returns one value/expression if it is true, and another if it is false — this can be useful in some situations, and can take up a lot less code than an if...else block if you have two choices that are chosen between via a true/false condition. The pseudocode looks like this:

```js
condition ? run this code : run this code instead
```

So let's look at a simple example:

```js
const greeting = isBirthday ? "Happy birthday Mrs. Smith — we hope you have a great day!" : "Good morning Mrs. Smith.";
```

The ternary operator is not just for setting variable values; you can also run functions, or lines of code — anything you like. The following live example shows a simple theme chooser where the styling for the site is applied using a ternary operator.

```html
<label for="theme">Select theme: </label>
<select id="theme">
  <option value="white">White</option>
  <option value="black">Black</option>
</select>

<h1>This is my website</h1>
```

```js
const select = document.querySelector("select");
const html = document.querySelector("html");
document.body.style.padding = "10px";

function update(bgColor, textColor) {
  html.style.backgroundColor = bgColor;
  html.style.color = textColor;
}

select.addEventListener("change", () =>
  select.value === "black"
    ? update("black", "white")
    : update("white", "black"),
);
```
