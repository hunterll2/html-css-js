# Handling text — strings in JavaScript

	Strings — represent and manipulate a sequence of characters.

## Declaring strings

When writing a string, you need to surround the value with quotes.

```js
const string = "The revolution will not be televised.";
console.log(string);
```

If you don't do this, or miss one of the quotes, you'll get an error.

```js
const badString1 = This is a test;
const badString2 = 'This is a test;
const badString3 = This is a test';
```

These lines don't work because any text without quotes around it is assumed to be a variable name, property name, a reserved word, or similar.

### Single quotes, double quotes, and backticks

In JavaScript, you can choose single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or backticks (`` ` ``) to wrap your strings in.

```js
const single = 'Single quotes';
const double = "Double quotes";
const backtick = `Backtick`;

console.log(single);
console.log(double);
console.log(backtick);
```

**Note:** You must use the same character for the start and end of a string, or you will get an error:

Strings declared using backticks are a special kind of string called a  [_template literal_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals). In most ways, template literals are like normal strings, but they have some special properties:

-   you can declare template literals over multiple lines
-   you can embed JavaScript in them

## Embedding JavaScript

Inside a template literal, you can wrap JavaScript variables or expressions inside `${ }`, and the result will be included in the string:

```js
const name = "Chris";

const greeting = `Hello, ${name}.
Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. 
Nam eligendi minus cum obcaecati velit, 
consequuntur nihil quod eum numquam error earum officia atque rem non dolor sed delectus.
Reprehenderit, rem?`;

console.log(greeting); // "Hello, Chris"
```

You can use the same technique to join together two variables:

```js
const one = "Hello, ";
const two = "how are you?";
const joined = `${one}${two}`;
console.log(joined); // "Hello, how are you?"
```

	Joining strings together like this is called _concatenation_.

### Concatenation in context

Let's have a look at concatenation being used in action:

```html
<button>Press me</button>
<div id="greeting"></div>
```

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", greet);

function greet() {
  const name = prompt("What is your name?");
  const greeting = document.querySelector("#greeting");
  greeting.textContent = `Hello ${name}, nice to see you!`;
}
```

Here we're using the [`window.prompt()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt "window.prompt()") function, which asks the user to answer a question via a popup dialog box then stores the text they enter inside a given variable — in this case `name`. We then display a string which inserts the name into a generic greeting message.

### Concatenation using "+"

You can only use  `${}`  with template literals, not with normal strings. You can concatenate normal strings using the  `+`  operator:

```js
const greeting = "Hello";
const name = "Chris";
console.log(greeting + ", " + name); // "Hello, Chris"
```

### Including expressions in strings

You can include JavaScript expressions in template literals, as well as just variables, and the results will be included in the result:

```js
const song = "Fight the Youth";
const score = 9;
const highestScore = 10;
const output = `I like the song ${song}. I gave it a score of ${
  (score / highestScore) * 100
}%.`;
console.log(output); // "I like the song Fight the Youth. I gave it a score of 90%."
```

## Multiline strings

Template literals respect the line breaks in the source code, so you can write strings that span multiple lines like this:

```js
const newline = `One day you finally knew
what you had to do, and began,`;
console.log(newline);

/*
One day you finally knew
what you had to do, and began,
*/
```

To have the equivalent output using a normal string you'd have to include line break characters (`\n`) in the string:

```js
const newline = "One day you finally knew\nwhat you had to do, and began,";
console.log(newline);
```

See [Template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) reference page for more examples and details of advanced features.

## Including quotes in strings

Since we use quotes to indicate the start and end of strings, how can we include actual quotes in strings? We know that this won't work:

```js
const badQuotes = "She said "I think so!"";
```

One common option is to use one of the other characters to declare the string:

```js
const goodQuotes1 = 'She said "I think so!"';
const goodQuotes2 = `She said "I'm not going in there!"`;
```

Another option is to  _escape_  the problem quotation mark. Escaping characters means that we do something to them to make sure they are recognized as text, not part of the code. In JavaScript, we do this by putting a backslash just before the character. Try this:

```js
const bigmouth = 'I\'ve got no right to take my place…';
console.log(bigmouth);
```

You can use the same technique to insert other special characters. See  [Escape sequences](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#escape_sequences)  for more details.

## Numbers vs. strings

What happens when we try to concatenate a string and a number? Let's try it in our console:

```
const name = "Front ";
const number = 242;
console.log(`${name}${number}`); // "Front 242"
```

You might expect this to return an error, but it works just fine. How numbers should be displayed as strings is fairly well-defined, so the browser automatically converts the number to a string and concatenates the two strings.

If you have a numeric variable that you want to convert to a string, or a string variable that you want to convert to a number, you can use the following two constructs:

-   The  [`Number()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/Number)  function converts anything passed to it into a number, if it can. Try the following:
    ```js
    const myString = "123";
    const myNum = Number(myString);
    console.log(typeof myNum);
    // number
    ```    
-   Conversely, the  [`String()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/String)  function converts its argument to a string. Try this:
	```js
	const myNum2 = 123;
	const myString2 = String(myNum2);
	console.log(typeof myString2);
	// string 
	```
    
These constructs can be really useful in some situations. For example, if a user enters a number into a form's text field, it's a string. However, if you want to add this number to something, you'll need it to be a number, so you could pass it through  `Number()`  to handle this.
